# MultipleChoiceAnswerer

To run the program, import it as an eclipse project and run the MCAnswerer class. A GUI window will then appear. Enter a multiple choice question and hit the find button.  The question must be entered in a certain way to avoid a parsing error.  The question must be on the first line with no proceeding characters or spaces. The choices must be directly below the question and one another with no line separation.  There must be two characters in front of each choice, with an optional space. The two characters are meant to be parsed as the choice identifier, i.e “a)”. Hit the find button and wait for the answer.
